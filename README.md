# Healio - A space for healing.

## Overview

Healio was created to be a means of connecting the valuable healer-type and the curious visitor-type of human. The visitor-type would visit this page and then engage with it, finding healing services and the healers that offer them in their local area. It should be a place for connection.

Healio uses a ReactJS client and a Rails API server to run. It incorporates packages from Material UI, Leaflet, Nominatim, and more.

Eventually, Healio will be launched regionally and then expand to meet a larger market. Accesibility is key. All visitors coming to healio can see a large list of the healers and services offered nearby.
